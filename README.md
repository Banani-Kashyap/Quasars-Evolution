# Redshift Evolution of Quasars

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the redshift evolution of quasars using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Quasars, being the most distant and brightest objects in the universe, provide valuable insights into the early history and evolution of the cosmos.

## Abstract

The discovery of quasars in the late 1950s revolutionized our understanding of the universe. In this project, we delve into the redshift evolution of quasars using data obtained from SDSS. By analyzing color-color diagrams, magnitude-redshift diagrams, and histograms of quasars in different redshift bins, we aim to uncover trends in their distribution over cosmic time.

## Data

The data used in this analysis is sourced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), a comprehensive survey of celestial objects covering a large portion of the sky. It includes information on quasar properties such as redshift, magnitude, and color.

## Analysis

### 1. Color-color Diagrams
We visualize the distribution of quasars in color-color space to understand their spectral characteristics and identify any trends.

### 2. Magnitude-redshift Diagrams
Magnitude-redshift diagrams are plotted to investigate how the brightness of quasars varies with redshift.

### 3. Histograms
Histograms of quasar properties such as redshift and magnitude are generated to analyze their distribution in different redshift bins.

### 4. Space Density Analysis
The space density of quasars is calculated and plotted against redshift to study their evolution over cosmic time. We examine trends in space density for quasars with different absolute magnitudes and across different sky regions covered by SDSS.

## Results

Our analysis reveals that the space density of quasars decreases rapidly with increasing redshift, particularly for quasars at z > 2.5. This suggests significant evolution in the quasar population over cosmic time.
